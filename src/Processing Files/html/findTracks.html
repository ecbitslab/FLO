##### SOURCE BEGIN #####
function [tcoords tracks] = findTracks(frame,scoords,nd_min,nd_max,bd_max,sfactor,debug)

%% Summary of function assignTracks:
%  Function that assigns track numbers to each bubble centroid to indicate
%  which bright points are actually the same bubble within a single frame.

%% Input and Output specifications:
% INPUT:
%
% - frame:    Image for which the centroid coordinates will be found.
%             Assume image has already been normalized in BT_Driver.
%
% - scoords:  Sorted coordinates of particle centroids in image frame 
%             returned by function getCntrdCoords.m.  Sorted such that the
%             lowest indices are closest to the source location.
%
% - srcang:   Angle (in radians) from the x axis (which divides the frame 
%             in half horizontally) that indicates the location of the flow
%             source.  An angle of 0 radians corresponds to the source
%             being in the center of the right side of the frame, pi/2
%             corresponds to being in the center of the top of the frame,
%             etc.  The angle is used rather than a specified coordinate of
%             the source because this allows more versatility between
%             cameras, settings, and experimental setups.  It is
%             recommended that the flow source be placed such that it is
%             located in the center of one of the four sides of the frame
%             for simplicity.
%
% - srcvel:   Direction of the source velocity.  This is used as the
%             initial velocity direction of the first bubble in any given
%             track (that is, the bubble in a track that is closest to the
%             source).
%
% - nd_min:   Minimum neighbor distance user defined in BT_Driver based on
%             the histogram of nearest neighbor distances.
%
% - nd_max:   Maximum neighbor distance user defined in BT_Driver based on
%             the histogram of nearest neighbor distances.
%
% - bd_max:   Maximum bubble diameter user defined in BT_Driver based on
%             the histogram of the bubbles' radii of gyration.
%
% - sfactor:  User defined search factor.  Multiplied by bd_max to
%             increase the search area when searching for candidates.
%
% - debug:    Flag to indicate whether or not the track finding process
%             should be shown for debugging or thresholding purposes.  Can 
%             be 0, 1, or 2. 0 = no display, 1 = initial bubble in track
%             and final track displayed, 2 = entire search process
%             displayed.
%
% OUTPUT:
%
% - tcoords:  Modified scoords matrix with an additional column to keep 
%             track of whether or not a particle is still active.
%
% - tracks:   Structure containing tracks for this frame.  Each track is
%             represented by a matrix containing the index values from
%             scoords for all bubbles in the same track
